# Travel-Agent-Path-Finder

It is difficult to plan a travel from one city to another city when you are required to use more than
one flight, you have to select and arrange the departure and arrival time for every flight in order
to minimize the time between each flight and the next so that the total travel time is minimum.
The project aims to solve this problem by creating a useful tool to solve the flights search problem,
using A* search algorithms.
